# Exercise Instructions

Let's improve the program from the last exercise

- Create the files `index.html` and `index.js`
- Set the document title to "Lesson 22"
- Include the `index.js` file into the `index.html`
- Inside the `index.js`:
  - Alert the user a welcoming message
    - "Enter two numbers to see if the first is greater than the second"
  - Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a variable
  - Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in a variable
  - Use an if/else if/else statement to show the user a more detailed message based on the result
    - if the number is greater, alert that its greater
    - else if the number is less than, alert that its less than
    - else the number is the same, alert that its the same
