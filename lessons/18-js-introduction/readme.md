# Lesson 18 - JavaScript Introduction

For the JavaScript portion of this course we will be utilizing the website [javascript.info](https://javascript.info). 

A large portion of programming is being able to search the web and find tutorials to teach you how to do what you need, so following along with these is a good introduction.

I will post the sections that you must read before completing the exercises for the lesson.

**The exercises will still remain in this GitHub repo.**
