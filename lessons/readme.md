# Exercises

Each folder here contains a different challenge that you need to complete. It is important to follow each exercise in order as they all build upon the knowledge gained in the previous ones.

## How to submit an exercise

1. Create a `branch` with a name related to what you are working on
   - Make sure you have your latest changes from `master`
   - `git checkout master`
   - `git pull origin master`
   - Then create a new branch for the exercise
   - e.g `git checkout -b 01-html-intro`
2. Read the `.md` file that is inside the exercise folder to learn the requirements
3. Create any required files for the exercise within that same folder
4. Commit your code (often!)
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Completes 01-html-introduction exercise"`
5. Push your changes to your GitHub repo
   - `git push origin 01-html-intro`
6. Open a Pull Request for the branch you just pushed against the `master` branch
   - Make sure the PR is on **your** repository, **not this one**!
7. Leave any questions or comments you have in the description, and mention me in either the description or a comment `@nehero` so I know to check it out
8. I'll go through and leave any comments or improvements (may take some time to get to everyones)
9. Once I've gone over it with you, merge it into master!

Going through this process likely isn't going to have an immediate feedback-loop, so please move on to the next exercise you feel comfortable doing as you complete them!
