No lesson here, let's get some practice in!

# Exercise Instructions

Copy all of the files you created for lesson 08-html-site and paste them inside this lessons folder.

We're going to take the site we built before and style it up a bit! Full creative freedom is in your hands, but here's a few goals:

- Have your image, page title, and navigation centered at the top of every page
- Display the navigation links to each page inline instead of stacked, using Flexbox
- Give the forms some breathing room! Use margin and padding to space things out
